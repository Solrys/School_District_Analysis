# School_District_Analysis
Analysis for School Districts

### Method
Python

Pandas

## Background 
Maria, the cheif data scientist for a city school district, is tasked with analyzing data from standardized tests for presentation. Maria has requested my help to uncover performance trends and patterns.  Using Pythonic code and Pandas in the Jupyter environment I was able to organize and analyze data from the csv files she has provided. After agregating the data to show the trends and school performance, the data can be used to better inform school budget allotments as well as other priorities. 

## Challlenge
Maria was notified by the school board that there was academic dishonesty surrounding the Thomas High School ninth graders. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards. Maria has therefor requested that I replace the Thomas High School ninth grade scores for math and reading with NaNs. 

## Results

In our original analysis there were several key metrics that were measured

 * District Summary
 * School Summary
 * The Average Math Score
 * The Average Reading Score
 * The Percentage of Passing Students for Math and Reading per School
 * The Top Five and Top Bottom Schools based on performance (the percentage of passing students)
 * Categorizing School Budgets 

Once we replaced the data for the 9th graders at the Thomas High School the data was adjusted as well and and there were several notable changes. 

## Notable Diferences in Thomas High School post 9th grade adjustments

 * The average reading score for Thomas High School changed
 * The average math score for Thomas high School Changed
 * The overall percentage of sudents passing changed
 * The top 5 schools in the district changed 
 * The district summary changed to reflect a changed percentage of passing studendts
 
 Before The changes made to the 9th grade
